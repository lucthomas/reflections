When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    A remote repository seems pretty awesome for collaboration. I place my commits and files on Github and somebody
    else can do this as well. As such the Github repository represents the complete work. I can imagine that Github
    allows me to pull files of others to place it on my local pc such that I can interact with them without changing
    the work of my colleagues.
    
    See all about "git remote" and "git push" in lesson 2
    
    NOTE: In order to pull files from Github to Git you can use "git pull origin(or chosen remoteName) master(or chosen branchName).

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
