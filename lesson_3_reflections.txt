When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    A remote repository seems pretty awesome for collaboration. I place my commits and files on Github and somebody
    else can do this as well. As such the Github repository represents the complete work. I can imagine that Github
    allows me to pull files of others to place it on my local pc such that I can interact with them without changing
    the work of my colleagues.

    See all about "git remote" and "git push" in lesson 2

    NOTE: In order to pull files from Github to Git you can use "git pull origin(or chosen remoteName) master(or chosen branchName)".

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    This might fill up memory space on your local pc that is not necessary.

    NOTE: use "touch filename.txt or .html, etc." to add a file in a folder

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forking: the act of pressing fork button in Github concerning someone else's repository. This then leads to this repository being cloned
    to your github account. But it is not cloned to your local pc.

    Cloning: cloning by means of "git clone https://github.com/..." is a means of cloning a repository from Github to your local pc such that
    you can interact with it with your Git.

    Branches: these are different versions (commits) of your files branched out in different branches such that you can easily transition from
    one version to the other without knowing the Id's of the versions.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
